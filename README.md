TZplus - 3 selectable timezones

NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, TZplus
loads as an app (at the same menu level as
"Settings" on the Pebble), not as a watchface
. . . it just displays a watchface

NOTE2: until a new version of the SDK exposes
functions for doing so, applications (including this
one) currently have no means to save/restore
settings . . . each time you start TZplus, it will
always revert to initial defaults . . . as soon as
functions are provided by the SDK that allow
apps to save/restore settings, TZplus will be
updated to take full advantage of them !!

Features (v1.0):
- select and display three timezones, plus local time,
  selectable on-the-fly (no recompile required) from
  a picklist of locations and timezones
- toggle between showing timezone #1& local time
  in upper time slot
- uses local time to determine offset from UTC on all
  displays
- displays nighttime as white characters on black
  background & daytime as black characters on white
  background
- displays +/- 1 to indicate that a particular timezone
  display is1-day ahead or 1-day behind UTC
- displays 12/24 hour format time (using current
  Pebble Settings)

Operating instructions:
- to toggle between local time and timezone 1 display
  in the upper slot, press the "select" (middle) button
  (when "set mode" is NOT active)
- to enter "set mode" (local), long-press the "select"
  (middle) button (upper slot displays local time,
  blinks "LOCAL" for 2-seconds, then the currently
  selected local timezone blinks)
- with "set mode" on "local", press the "up" &
  "down" buttons to change the local timezone (note
  that the hour & minute displayed for local time will
  not change since this time corresponds to either the
  time sync'd from your phone or the time set in the
  Pebble's Settings: Date & Time menu)
- to change "set mode" to "timezone 1", press the
  "select" button (upper slot displays timezone 1
  time, blinks "TIMEZONE 1" for 2-seconds, then
  the currently selected timezone 1 blinks)
- with "set mode" on "timezone 1", press the "up" &
  "down" buttons to change timezone 1 2(note that
  the time for timezone 1 will adjust in sync with the
  selected timezone to reflect the offset from UTC,
  taking into consideration the local offset from
  UTC selected earlier)
- to change "set mode" to "timezone 2", press the
  "select" button (the currently selected timezone 2
  blinks in the middle slot)
- with "set mode" on "timezone 2", press the "up" &
  "down" buttons to change timezone 2 (note that
  the time for timezone 2 will adjust in sync with the
  selected timezone to reflect the offset from UTC,
  taking into consideration the local offset from
  UTC selected earlier)
- to change "set mode" to "timezone 3", press the
  "select" button (the currently selected timezone 3
  blinks in the lower slot)
- with "set mode" on "timezone 3", press the "up" &
  "down" buttons to change timezone 3 (note that
  the time for timezone 3 will adjust in sync with the
  selected timezone to reflect the offset from UTC,
  taking into consideration the local offset from
  UTC selected earlier)
- to change "set mode" to "local", press the
  "select" button (upper slot displays local time,
  blinks "LOCAL" for 2-seconds, then the currently
  selected local timezone blinks)
- to exit "set mode" at anytime, long-press the "select"
  button (nothing blinking)
